<div class="about">
<span>What is this site all about?</span>
We are one2many.  We foster a culture that celebrates giving & helping, 
that inspires people to be generous & compassionate.
People donate used goods to us and we then give these items away to people for free, 
in exchange for their volunteer service at local organizations 
(like Habitat for Humanity, local soup kitchens, after school reading programs and the Special Olympics).
</div>

<div class="about">
<span>How can you tell how much I volunteered?</span>
When you volunteer at a participating organization, they give you a coupon ("Karma Kash") with a unique code on it. 
You then log in to the site to enter the code, which is added to your "hours account" balance.
This balance can be used to buy items in our inventory.
